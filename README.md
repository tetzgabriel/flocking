# Flocking Simulation
This is a small flocking simulation example using *p5.js* (and materilialize BTW).

I made this inspired on the Boids algorithm created by Craig Reynolds and by *Coding Challenge #124: Flocking Simulation* video of The Coding Train.
Basicaly the dots in your screen follow 3 simple rules:

<ul>
  <li>The [Alignment Rule Image](https://i.imgur.com/z73JhEf.gif)</li>
  <ul>
    <li>That causes the boids points towards the average heading of other next boids</li>
  </ul>
  <li>The [Cohesion Rule Image](https://i.imgur.com/uanlXSl.gif) and</li>
  <ul>
    <li>This makes the boid to steer towards the center of mass of the flock</li>
  </ul>
  <li>The [Separation Rule Image](https://i.imgur.com/eaSkcU7.gif)</li>
  <ul>    
    <li>Test</li>
   </ul>
</ul>

You can read more about these rules [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boids), but the basicaly cause that the boids
