# Flocking Simulation
This is a small flocking simulation example using *p5.js* (and materilialize BTW).

I made this inspired on the Boids algorithm created by Craig Reynolds and by *Coding Challenge #124: Flocking Simulation* video of The Coding Train.
Basicaly the dots in your screen follow 3 simple rules:
